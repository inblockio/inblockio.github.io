            <h2>inblock.io Adopts the AI Discovery Standard</h2>

            <p>We are pleased to announce that inblock.io now implements the <a href="https://rootz.global/ai-discovery" target="_blank">AI Discovery Standard</a> proposed by Rootz. Our website serves a structured <code>/.well-known/ai</code> endpoint that provides AI agents with verified, first-party information about our organization, technology, and mission.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

            <p>AI systems today increasingly mediate how organizations are discovered and understood. Search engines, chatbots, and autonomous agents process billions of queries daily. Yet most websites remain opaque to these systems: JavaScript-heavy pages, unstructured HTML, and scattered metadata force AI to guess rather than know. The result is hallucination, misrepresentation, and lost context.</p>

            <p>The AI Discovery Standard addresses this with a simple, powerful idea: give organizations a standardized way to present verified information directly to AI agents. A single JSON file at <code>/.well-known/ai</code> serves as a machine-readable identity card, accessible in one request.</p>

            <h3>Our Implementation</h3>

            <p>We have implemented all three tiers of the specification:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tier 1 &ndash; Discovery</strong> (<code>/.well-known/ai</code>): Our organizational identity, core concepts, products, and capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 2 &ndash; Knowledge</strong> (<code>/ai/knowledge.json</code>): Comprehensive reference including the Aqua Protocol architecture, our GitHub repositories, team, and technical glossary.</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 3 &ndash; Feed</strong> (<code>/ai/feed.json</code>): A structured, AI-optimized update stream with semantic tags, replacing traditional RSS for AI consumption.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Natural Alignment with Aqua Protocol</h3>

            <p>The AI Discovery Standard aligns naturally with our work on the Aqua Protocol. Both share a fundamental conviction: trust should be built on verifiable, structured data rather than blind faith in platforms.</p>

            <p>Where the AI Discovery Standard gives organizations a voice that AI can trust, Aqua Protocol provides the cryptographic infrastructure to make that trust mathematically provable. Portable hash-chains, modular signatures, and immutable timestamps can extend the standard's signature layer into a full provenance framework, ensuring not just that information is structured, but that it is authentic and untampered.</p>

            <p>As AI agents become more autonomous, the need for verifiable organizational identity will only grow. We see the <code>/.well-known/ai</code> endpoint as a natural extension of the trust infrastructure we are building.</p>

            <h3>Supporting Standardization</h3>

            <p>We support the standardization of the <code>/.well-known/ai</code> endpoint and encourage other organizations to adopt it. The specification is open (CC-BY-4.0), free to implement, and vendor-neutral. An IANA registration is being prepared to formalize the endpoint.</p>

            <p>For organizations working in data governance, digital sovereignty, or AI infrastructure, this is an opportunity to shape how the AI-readable web is built, ensuring it reflects the values of transparency, accuracy, and verified trust.</p>
