> Building trust infrastructure for sovereign data ownership through the Aqua Protocol.

inblock.io assets GmbH develops open-source cryptographic trust infrastructure. Our core technology, the Aqua Protocol, enables decentralized notarization, verifiable data chains, and cryptographic data accounting — giving organizations full control over their own data without third-party dependencies.

## Core Technology

- [Aqua Protocol](https://aqua-protocol.org): Open protocol for cryptographic data accounting. Creates immutable, DAG-like ledger structures for every file with portable trust across organizational boundaries.
- [Aqua Protocol V4](https://aqua-protocol.org/v4): Addresses the AI security gap with verifiable agent identity, granular access control, and tamper-proof provenance for autonomous systems.

## Products

- [AquaFire Application](https://aquafier.inblock.io): Aqua Protocol v3.2 enabled Document Management System with integrated identity verification and document e-signing.
- [Aqua JS SDK](https://github.com/inblockio/aqua-js-sdk): Developer tools for building applications with the Aqua Protocol. TypeScript implementation. GPL-3.0 licensed.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Accounting**: Applying rigorous accounting standards to data through cryptographic verification, ensuring provenance, integrity, and authenticity.
- **Digital Sovereignty**: Full control over one's own data through self-hosted, open-source trust infrastructure without dependency on external platforms.
- **Decentralized Notarization**: On-premises document notarization providing secure, verifiable proof without third-party involvement.
- **AquaTree**: A portable data structure recording revision history with cryptographic precision, where each change links via hash to its predecessor.
- **Portable Hash-Chains**: Cryptographic chains of hashes forming immutable revision histories that can be independently verified without a central authority.
